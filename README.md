## Introduction  
I got tired of waiting for my machine learning projects to train while sitting at my computer never knowing how much longer was 
left. I wanted to be able to leave my pc and get other things done while the program ran. This has also been used as a price  
alert script when an item you are keeping an eye on drops below a certain price.  
  
## Prerequisites  
- Python 3.6  
- smtplib module for python (Documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html )  
- Gmail account  
- 2FA key for web apps to use your gmail account  
## To Use  
1. On line 7, type in the subject of the email you are sending  
2. On line 20, type in the email you are sending the messege from along with the key made for google 2FA  
3. On line 25, type in the email you are sending the messege from  
4. On line 35, type in what the body of the email should be along with the email address you would like to send it to  
 
## Notes  
- This was written in OOP form, so you are able to add it into any of your current programs  
- You are able to attach files to emails with this current script by adding in a few lines of code
